# Integrations (`integrations`) - specification

Master prompt section 15.3. The integration framework (INTG-001: ports, mock adapters, contract
tests and the inbound quarantine queue) and the communications adapters (INTG-011) are specified in
[platform.md](platform.md#integrations-framework-intg-001) and [comms.md](comms.md). This file holds
the adapters Phase 2 adds ([phase-2.md](../plans/phase-2.md), lane H) and, later, the others.
**Stub**: written with the Phase 2 plan to hold the headings and the rows; each lane H slice writes
its section before its code. Status per feature: [feature register](feature-register.md).

## 1. Purpose and register rows

Section 15.3: connect Harbour to the partners a provider already uses, each behind a domain
interface with a contract test and a mock, so a tenant without the partner still has a working
product.

| Row | Feature (register) | Phase | Plan slices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INTG-006 | dm+d dataset sync and GTIN barcode lookup | 2 | 10 (reference tables and loader), 75 (download job) |
| INTG-007 | Identity and vetting: right-to-work IDSP, DBS e-bulk and Update Service, NMC register lookup | 2 | 77 |
| INTG-013 | E-signature and OCR adapters (optional DocuSign, camera scanning with OCR for paper MARs) | 2 | 79 |
| SCHED-008 | Payroll and pension exports (Xero Payroll first, Staffology, Sage, BrightPay; auto-enrolment flags) | 2 | 76 |
| WORK-006 | SCORM and xAPI e-learning player and LMS integration (the LMS imports) | 2 | 78 |

Later phases (register): INTG-002 to INTG-005, INTG-008 and INTG-010 (Phase 5), INTG-009 (Phase 4),
INTG-012 (Phase 3); the pharmacy interface MEDS-010 (Phase 5).

## 2. Schema

To be written by each slice. Connections per tenant use `integration_connection`; credentials stay
in the secret store (section 15.3 rules).

## 3. Permissions

To be written by each slice. Choosing a provider for a tenant is a tenant setting
([platform.md](platform.md)).

## 4. Rules that are easy to get wrong

Section 15.3 rules, for every adapter:

- an adapter behind a domain interface, with a contract test and a mock;
- credentials per tenant in the secret store;
- inbound data validated against Zod schemas and quarantined on failure, with a visible queue;
- integration health on the operator console.

Section 15.3 sets the dm+d sync as monthly; section 12.3 says approved timesheets go to payroll by
API or file, with auto-enrolment flags (`auto_enrolment.earnings_trigger`).

## 5. API and events

To be written by each slice.

## 6. Offline behaviour

The device holds the dm+d subset for its assigned people's medicines (section 17.1); scanning with
OCR happens on the phone camera (section 15.3, documents).

## 7. Clinical safety

dm+d data out of date or loaded wrongly is HZ-113; scanned or imported medicines stay "not yet
checked" until a second competent user checks them (HZ-005).

## 8. Data protection

A third-party service that receives personal data joins the
[sub-processor register](../compliance/sub-processors.md) and the DPIA (section 20 rule 8). Which
Phase 2 partners count as sub-processors is a DPO decision (H-520).

## 9. Acceptance criteria and tests

To be written by each slice: the port's contract tests pass against the mock and the real adapter.

## 10. Open questions

The decisions and defaults are in [phase-2.md](../plans/phase-2.md) (ADR-0013, ADR-0080, ADR-0094,
ADR-0095, ADR-0097) and the human actions in [human-actions.md](../plans/human-actions.md) (H-510,
H-511, H-518 to H-523, H-532, H-540).
